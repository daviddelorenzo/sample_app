<p style="width:500px; display:inline; text-align: left; margin-bottom: 100px; color:beige;"> This project is the one you are currently viewing. I have very limited experience with rails and am by no means an expert. My coding style and practices for HTML and CSS are not professional, but this is not my area of expertise. This project mainly serves to put on display small coding snippets and prove that I can learn new concepts quickly. I have taken special care to make the UI user friendly and the format style clean. Feel free to shoot me an email if you have suggestions for improving my site!
